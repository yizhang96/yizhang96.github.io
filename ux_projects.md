Hello! Here are some projects I worked on the side of my research at USC. Using mixed quantitative tools, I hope to help people better understand themselves and make more adaptive decisions.

## [Social network analysis of dreams](/project_dream_network)
[#Social network analysis]()&nbsp;&nbsp;
[#Natural language processing]()&nbsp;&nbsp;
[#Sentiment analysis]()&nbsp;&nbsp;
[#Python]()

Since 2019, I have been keeping a dream journal. In this project, I analyzed the first 100 entries in my dream corpus. Using social network analysis and natural language processing, I hope to unveil my unconscious in a quantitative way.

## [User research for the PaceTodo App](/project_pacetodo)
[#UX research]()&nbsp;&nbsp;
[#Product design]()&nbsp;&nbsp;
[#R]()

Delays are very common among college students and are often caused by inaccurate time perceptions. In this project, I conducted user research and data analyses to inform the design of *PaceTodo*---a 7-day task management app that copes with procrastination by providing real-time emotional support and task-planning suggestions.
