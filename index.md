## Abot Me
Hi! I’m a PhD student in Psychology at USC. I work with Leor Hackel. I'm broadly interested in the nature of emotion, morality, and how they shape how we interact with other humans.

Before graduate school, I received my B.A. in Psychology and Philosophy from NYU where I worked in Jay Van Bavel and Jon Freeman's labs . Then, I worked as a lab manager at Columbia in Kevin Ochsner’s lab.

Besides research, I am into reading and a variety of sports, particularly tennis, running, and skiing.

## Research
I am working on three lines of research.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/yizhang96/yizhang96.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/yizhang96/yizhang96.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
