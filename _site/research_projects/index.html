  <h2 id="how-do-people-learn-to-empathize-with-others">How do people learn to empathize with others?</h2>
<p>Empathy is not equal. We empathize more with some people than others. Past research suggets that this is because empathy is <em>motivated</em>: we empathy with others because we <em>want to</em> empathize with them.</p>

<p>I do not believe this is the full story. In this line of work, I examine whether empathy can arise in the absence of explicit goals to empathize. I hypothesize that empathy can arise from associative learning. When another person’s outcome has been consistently paired with our own outcomes of the same (opposite) valence, we become more (less) empathic towards them.</p>

<p>Preliminary findings from this project were presented at the Society for Affective Science (SAS) 2021 Conference.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-people-respond-to-social-rejection-in-social-networks">How do people respond to social rejection in social networks?</h2>
<p>Social rejection is a prevalent phenomenon in human societies and is consequential to health and well being. By definition, social rejection involves at least two parties–the rejector and the rejected. However, rejectio rarely takes place in a social vacuum. How people respond to rejection depends not only on the <em>dyadic</em> relationship between the two parties, but also the complex social environment they are embedded in. In this line of work, I examine how the structure of the rejector’s social network affects how people respond to rejection.</p>

<p>Data from this project has been presented at the Society of Personality and Social Psychology (SPSP) 2022 Conference.</p>
