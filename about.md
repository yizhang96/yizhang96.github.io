title: About me
---

  Hi! I’m a PhD student in Psychology at USC. I work with [Leor Hackel](https://www.hackellab.org). I’m broadly interested in the nature of emotion and morality, and how they shape how we interact with other humans. My research uses a multi-method approach, using tools such as quantitative survey, psychophysiological task, and social network analysis.

  Before graduate school, I received my B.A. in Psychology and Philosophy from NYU where I studied the effect of partisan identity on fake news perception in Jay Van Bavel's lab and completed my honors thesis on the expression of racial and political prejudice in Jon Freeman’s lab. Then, I worked as a lab manager at Columbia in Kevin Ochsner’s lab, where I studied person perception and emotion regulation across individual, dyadic, and social network contexts.

  Besides research, I am also passionate about science communication. Since 2021, I have been writing and translating articles for [Neureality (神经现实)](https://neu-reality.com), a leading non-profit science communication platform in China.
