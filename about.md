title: About me
---

  Hi! I’m a PhD student in Psychology at USC. I work with [Leor Hackel](https://www.hackellab.org). I’m broadly interested in the nature of emotion, morality, and how they shape how we interact with other humans. My research uses a multi-method approach, using tools such as qualitative survey, psychophysiological task, and social network analysis.

  Before graduate school, I received my B.A. in Psychology and Philosophy from NYU where I worked in Jay Van Bavel and Jon Freeman’s labs . Then, I worked as a lab manager at Columbia in Kevin Ochsner’s lab.

  Besides research, I am also passionate about science communication. Since 2021, I have been writing and translating articles for [Neureality (神经现实)](https://neu-reality.com), a leading non-profit science communication platform in China.
