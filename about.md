title: About me
---

Hi! I’m a PhD student in Psychology at USC. I work with [Leor Hackel](https://www.hackellab.org). I’m broadly interested how emotion shapes social connection and wellbeing. My research uses a multi-method approach, using tools such as quantitative survey, psychophysiological task, and social network analysis.

Before graduate school, I received my B.A. in Psychology and Philosophy from NYU where I studied the effect of partisan identity on fake news perception and prejudice expression in Jay Van Bavel and Jon Freeman’s labs. Then, I worked as a lab manager at Columbia in Kevin Ochsner’s lab, where I studied person perception and emotion regulation across the brain, dyadic, and social network levels.

Besides research, I am also passionate about science communication. Since 2021, I have been writing and translating articles for [Neureality (神经现实)](https://neu-reality.com), a leading science communication platform in China.
