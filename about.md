title: About me
---


  Hi! I’m a PhD student in Psychology at USC. I work with [Leor Hackel](https://www.hackellab.org). I’m broadly interested in the nature of emotion, morality, and how they shape how we interact with other humans.

  Before graduate school, I received my B.A. in Psychology and Philosophy from NYU where I worked in Jay Van Bavel and Jon Freeman’s labs . Then, I worked as a lab manager at Columbia in Kevin Ochsner’s lab.

  Besides research, I am into reading and a variety of sports, particularly tennis, running, and skiing.
